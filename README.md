# SeSiMCMC revisited: Stochastic Chaos participates in IBIS challenge

### Team name
Stochastic Chaos

### Primary Disciplines
A2G-PWM, G2A-PWM -- actually, we tried to identify motifs in everything we could extract one from.

## Summary

SeSiMCMC is a Gibbs sampler for de-novo identification of similar nucleotide substrings in the input. The input is a collection of nucleotide sequences, and we know that many of them contain the binding sites of the TF of interest. So, the substrings are supposed to be the TF binding sites of the TF. The algorythm uses PWM model to describe the motif. The SeSIMCMC paper was published 20 years ago, and our main goal of participation in the challenge was to answer whether the algorythhms of this class are still usable in the modern world of deep learning models.

## Motif search
We searched for motifs in the fasta files (see folow) using the SeSiMCMC (https://github.com/favorov/SeSiMCMC) software.
Generally, it 

The default search parameters were used, with two adjustmets. For SMiLE-seq, we set the probability for an input sequence to be garbage (i.e not to carry the motif) to 0.9 instead of the default 0.1 . For all the runs, we set the number of chains (attempts) to 7 instead of default 3. The time limit was posted to 10000 seconds (the default is 1000). 

We added --ibis command-line switch to SeSiMCMC to generate the IBIS challenge output.

All the SeSiMCMC runs were done by a bash script. The script was generated by an R script simultatneously with the fasta data preparation.


## Fasta preparation.
To  prepare the fasta and to generate the bash script to run the motif search in the faasta, we wrpte R script https://gitlab.com/favorov/stochaos-ibis-challenge/-/blob/main/scripts/prepare_fasta_and_script.R?ref_type=heads. To prepare the fasta, the peaks files were truncated to get the best peaks and then the peaks were mapped to hg38 genome. The SMILEseq file were subsetted at random and coverted to fasta. The PBM files were subsetted so that only the intersestion of the best records according to z-score and the best according to the foreground level.

## PWM joining.
The SeSiMCMC --ibis switch generally do wht we need, still when the task fails, am empty PWM file or a text with commented options of SeSIMCMC run appears. To filter this garbage out and to join the valid pwms, we wropte perl script https://gitlab.com/favorov/stochaos-ibis-challenge/-/blob/main/scripts/join_pwms.pl . The script also controlled the format compliance.
